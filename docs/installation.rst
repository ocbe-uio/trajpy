Installation
============
Clone the repository to your local directory ::

  git clone https://github.com/phydev/trajpy

from your terminal. Then run the setup.py for installing ::

  python setup.py --install

We have the package hosted in test.pypi, after the first release we will migrate it to PyPi.
But for now you can install it from there using the following command: ::

  pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ trajpy
