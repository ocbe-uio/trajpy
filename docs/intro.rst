Introduction
============
Trajectory classification is a challenging task and fundamental for
analysing the movement of nanoparticles, bacteria, cells and active
matter in general.

We propose TrajPy as an easy pythonic solution to be applied in studies that
demand trajectory classification. It requires little knowledge of programming
and physics to be used by nonspecialists.

TrajPy is composed of three main units of code:

- The training data set is built using a **trajectory generator**
- **Features** are computed for characterizing the trajectories
- The **classifier** built on Scikit-Learn.

Our dataset and Machine Learning (ML) model are available for use, as well
the generator for building your own database.
